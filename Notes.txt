Your browser doesn't just request the HTML page â€” it also parses that HTML and then makes additional requests for any resources referenced in it

Notice the URLs

/*
if(pathname ==="/overview")
{
    const html = await fs.readFile('./view/overview.html', 'utf-8')
}
//Actual code is as per required, just note the URl pattern
Requested URL : http://localhost:3000/overview
*/

and in

/*
else if(/\.(png)$/i.test(req.url))
{
    const image = await fs.readFile(`./public/image/${req.url.slice(1)}`)
}
*/

and compare actual requestedServer is running

The route requested /0.png
Requested URL : http://localhost:3000/0.png
Search parameteres : 
null
undefined


So math the routes in code with URLs in template.
